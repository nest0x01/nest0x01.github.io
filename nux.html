            <p dir="auto">
                <code>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</code>
                refers to software developed under principles that grant users
                the freedom to access, study, modify, and redistribute its
                source code. This paradigm enables researchers, developers, and
                organizations to adapt software to specific needs while
                contributing improvements back to the wider community. FOSS
                thereby promotes transparency, collaborative innovation, and
                collective technological advancement.

                <span>2. History</span>
            </div>
            <p dir="auto">
                Emerging in the 1970s from the hacker culture at the
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the movement was
                formalized in 1983 when
                <strong><code>Richard Stallman</code></strong> of the MIT
                Artificial Intelligence Laboratory launched the GNU Project to
                counteract the growing restrictions imposed by proprietary
                software. These restrictions were transforming an open culture
                of collaboration and knowledge exchange into one of secrecy and
                limited autonomy.
                <br />
                <br />
                The GNU Project aimed to develop a completely free, Unix-like
                operating system that would promote software freedom. In 1991,
                Finnish software engineer
                <strong><code>Linus Torvalds</code></strong> released Linux,
                which—combined with GNU software—formed the first fully
                functional open-source operating system, often referred to as
                GNU/Linux.
                <br />
                <br />
                The term "open source", coined in 1998 by
                <strong><code>Eric S. Raymond</code></strong> and
                <strong><code>Bruce Perens</code></strong> through the Open
                Source Initiative (OSI), made the concept more
                business-friendly, diverging from Stallman's ethical stance.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, FOSS constitutes the foundation of digital
                infrastructure, powering web servers, mobile devices,
                supercomputers, the Darwin/XNU kernel of macOS, blockchain
                technologies, and even systems used aboard the International
                Space Station.
                <br />
                <br />
                Despite its technical merits, GNU/Linux holds only about 3.2% of
                the desktop and laptop market share. This is largely due to
                Microsoft's aggressive and long-standing anticompetitive
                practices, including exclusionary licensing agreements, fear,
                uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) campaigns, and software lock-in
                mechanisms designed to undermine open-source adoption and
                suppress GNU/Linux’s growth in government and enterprise
                sectors. The strategy known as "embrace, extend, and extinguish"
                describes Microsoft's approach of adopting open standards,
                adding proprietary features to create incompatibility, and
                ultimately marginalizing competitors(United States v. Microsoft
                Corp., 2001)..

            <div class="ptitle">
                <span>3. Philosophy</span>
            </div>
            <p dir="auto">
                FOSS is a shared public good, rejecting profit-driven
                restrictions. Stallman's (1985) four freedoms—to run, study,
                share, and modify software—uphold principles of freedom,
                collaboration, and autonomy.
                <br />
                <br />
                Eric Raymond's (1999) influential essay 'The Cathedral and the
                Bazaar' praised transparent, merit-based "bazaar" collaboration
                over hierarchical development models, blending altruism with
                reputation-based motivation.
                <br />
                <br />
                FOSS is not only a technical paradigm but also a sociopolitical
                stance: information and knowledge should thrive without
                barriers.
            </p>
            <span class="ptitle"> 4. Hackers' Culture </span>

            <p dir="auto">
                The Hackers’ culture prizes curiosity, the joy of tinkering,
                cleverness, and a playful approach to problem-solving. For
                example, GNU’s recursive acronym—“GNU’s Not Unix”—is itself a
                playful pun celebrating both technical lineage and mischievous
                creativity.
                <br />
                <br />
                Hacker communities learn by exploring, experimenting, and openly
                sharing knowledge and discovery. Hackers view technology as a
                playground: they explore systems not just to use them, but to
                understand, modify, and repurpose them in unexpected ways.
                <br />
                <br />
                Alongside the playfulness lies a serious ethic: respect for
                skill and technical excellence, and a belief in meritocracy in
                which reputation comes from what you can build or hack, not
                formal credentials.
            </p>

            <span class="ptitle"> 5. Unix Heritage </span>

            <p dir="auto">
                GNU/Linux follows the philosophy of Unix, an operating system
                developed at Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s. The Unix
                design principles emphasize simple, modular programs that "do
                one thing well" and can be combined flexibly to accomplish
                complex tasks.
                <br />
                <br />
                Initially adopted by universities, research institutions, and
                large corporations, Unix became one of the most influential
                operating systems in computing history. Its architectural
                philosophy profoundly shaped the design of modern operating
                systems, including GNU/Linux, BSD variants, and even proprietary
                systems such as macOS.
