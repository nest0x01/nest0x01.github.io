## A Brief Opiniated Overview of The Free Open Source Mouvement

### Informal definition
  `Free Open Source Software (FOSS)` refers to software that is developed in a way where researchers, developers and organizations can study how the software works, adapt it for their own needs, and share improvements back with the broader community.

### Brief History
  Born in the 1970s from the hackers culture at MIT, the movement formalized in 1983 when `Richard Stallman` from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, launched the GNU Project to fight restrictions in proprietary softwares which were transforming the open culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing by secrecy and limited freedom. The GNU Project's objective was to create a free, Unix-like operating system, promoting software freedom and the development of open-source software. In 1991, Finnish software engineer `Linus Torvalds` released Linux which, combined with GNU's free softwares, formed the first complete, open-source operating system, often referred to as GNU/Linux. The "open source" label, coined in 1998 by `Eric S. Raymond` and `Bruce Perens` via the Open Source Initiative, made it business-friendly, diverging from Stallman's ethics. FOSS is now powering the internet infrastructure, smart appliances, supercomputers, the kernel of macOS (Darwin/XNU), Cryptocurrencies, the International Space Station, etc. It has become a fundamental tool in the IT industry. Despite its technical merits, GNU/Linux only holds approximately 3.2% of the desktop and laptop market share. This is mainly due to Microsoft ferocious anticompetitive tactics—like exclusionary deals, FUD campaigns, and software lock-in—to undermine open-source adoption and suppress GNU/Linux’s growth in government and enterprise sectors. "Embrace, extend, and extinguish" is a strategy used by Microsoft to dominate markets by first adopting open standards, then adding proprietary features that create compatibility issues, and finally marginalizing competitors.

### Philosophy
  FOSS are a shared public good, rejecting profit-driven enforced restrictions. Stallman's four freedoms —to run, study, share, and modify— uphold freedom, collaboration and autonomy. Raymond's book 'Cathedral and the Bazaar' praised transparent, merit-based "bazaar" collaboration over hierarchies, blending altruism with reputation gains. It's a political stand: information and knowledge must thrive without barriers.

### Hackers' culture
  Hackers’ culture prizes curiosity, the joy of tinkering, cleverness, and a playful approach to problem-solving. For example GNU’s recursive acronym—“GNU’s Not Unix”—is itself a playful wordplay that celebrates both technical lineage and mischievous creativity. The result is a community that learns by making, sharing, and laughing together. Hackers see technology as a playground: they explore systems not just to use them, but to understand how they work, to bend its use in unexpected ways. Alongside the play, though, there’s a serious ethic: respect for skill and technical excellence, and a belief in meritocracy where reputation comes from what you can build or hack, not formal credentials.

### Unix
  Unix is one of the most influential operating systems, created in the late 1960s at Bell Labs. It was designed to be simple, reliable, and able to support multiple users at once. Unix was mainly used in universities, research labs, and large companies to run servers and powerful computers that managed data and networks. Over time, Unix became the foundation for many modern systems — including GNU/Linux amd macOS.
