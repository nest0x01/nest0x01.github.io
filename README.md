#### Free Open Source Software : Core Bits
---
##### Informal definition

`Free Open Source Software (FOSS)` refers to software that is developed in a way where researchers, developers and organizations can study how the software works, adapt it for their own needs, and share improvements back with the broader community.

##### Brief History

Born in the 1970s from the hackers culture at MIT, the movement formalized in 1983 when **`Richard Stallman`** from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Launched the GNU Project to challenge restrictions in proprietary software, which were shifting the open culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing toward one of secrecy and limited freedom. The GNU Project's objective was to create a free, Unix-like operating system, promoting software freedom and the development of open-source software. In 1991, Finnish software engineer **`Linus Torvalds`** released Linux which, combined with GNU's free software, formed the first complete, open-source operating system, often referred to as GNU/Linux. The "open source" label, coined in 1998 by **`Eric S. Raymond`** and **`Bruce Perens`** via the Open Source Initiative, made it business-friendly, diverging from Stallman's ethics. FOSS is now powering the internet infrastructure, smart appliances, supercomputers, the kernel of macOS (Darwin/XNU), Cryptocurrencies, the International Space Station, etc. It has become a fundamental tool in the IT industry. Despite its technical merits, GNU/Linux only holds approximately 3.2% of the desktop and laptop market share. This is mainly due to Microsoft's ferocious anticompetitive tactics—like exclusionary deals, FUD campaigns, and software lock-in—to undermine open-source adoption and suppress GNU/Linux’s growth in government and enterprise sectors. "Embrace, extend, and extinguish" is a strategy used by Microsoft to dominate markets by first adopting open standards, then adding proprietary features that create compatibility issues, and finally marginalizing competitors.

##### Philosophy

FOSS are a shared public good, rejecting profit-driven enforced restrictions. Stallman's four freedoms —to run, study, share, and modify— uphold freedom, collaboration and autonomy. Raymond's book 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar' praised transparent, merit-based "bazaar" collaboration over hierarchies, blending altruism with reputation gains. It's a political stand: information and knowledge must thrive without barriers.

##### Hackers' culture

Hackers’ culture prizes curiosity, the joy of tinkering, cleverness, and a playful approach to problem-solving. For example GNU’s recursive acronym—“GNU’s Not Unix”—is itself a playful wordplay that celebrates both technical lineage and mischievous creativity. The result is a community that learns by making, sharing, and laughing together. Hackers see technology as a playground: they explore systems not just to use them, but to understand how they work, to bend their use in unexpected ways. Alongside the play, though, there’s a serious ethic: respect for skill and technical excellence, and a belief in meritocracy where reputation comes from what you can build or hack, not formal credentials.

##### Unix's Heritage

GNU/Linux follows Unix's philosphy that emphasize building simple, modular programs that do one thing well that can be combined flexibly to accomplish complex tasks. Created in the late 1960s at Bell Labs, Unix was mainly used in universities, research labs, and large companies. It is one of the most influential operating systems.

`This community that we have, that we're building, that does so much, has to grow. We can't compete with Apple, we can't compete with Google, directly, in the field of resources. What we can eventually do is head count and heart count. We can compete on the ground of ideology because ours is better.`
-- `Edward Snowden`, NSA whistleblower, speaking at LibrePlanet 2016.
